    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Noveler is a platform built for authors and creators who need to organize and evolve their story characters across projects such as novels, movies, and games. Think of it as Git for storytelling. Authors can create characters, edit them, and track every change in detail using a powerful version control system designed specifically for storytelling.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-200 mb-4">Why Noveler?</h2>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Creative projects often evolve over time, and so do characters. With Noveler, every modification—whether it’s a new ability, a name change, or a dramatic character arc—is tracked. You’ll never lose important details again. Go back in time, compare revisions, and restore past versions as needed.
